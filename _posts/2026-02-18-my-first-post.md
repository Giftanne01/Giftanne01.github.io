## Why Cybersecurity?

I am a software engineering student with a focused interest in cybersecurity, particularly in ethical hacking, network security, and offensive security.
My curiosity about how systems can be exploited and secured drives my commitment to understanding vulnerabilities at a deeper technical level.
I am motivated by the responsibility of protecting user data and defending businesses against evolving cyber threats
As digital infrastructure continues to expand, robust security is essential — not optional. I aim to build expertise in identifying weaknesses, strengthening systems, and contributing to security research that anticipates emerging attack vectors.
Through hands-on projects and continuous learning, I am developing the technical foundation required to contribute meaningfully to secure system design.
I am seeking opportunities that will challenge me, refine my skills, and position me to make a measurable impact in the cybersecurity field.

### What I'm Learning

- Offensive security fundamentals
- Penetration testing methodologies
- Building security tools

### Goals for the Next 3 Months

1. Complete TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester path
2. Build 8+ security tools
3. Publish 20+ write-ups
4. Participate in live CTF competitions

Stay tuned for more updates!
